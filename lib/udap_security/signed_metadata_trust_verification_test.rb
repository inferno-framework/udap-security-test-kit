       The UDAP IG profile on UDAP Server Metadata Section 3.2 says:
       > The Client app attempts to construct a valid certificate chain from the Serverâ€™s certificate (cert1) to an
       > anchor certificate trusted by the Client app using conventional X.509 chain building techniques and path
       > validation, including certificate validity and revocation status checking. The Server MAY provide a complete
       > certificate chain in the x5c element. The Client app MAY use additional certificates not included by the Server
       > to construct a chain.

       This test will establish trust against the root CA(s) provided as test inputs.
       Currently, the use of Authority Information Access (AIA) extensions is NOT supported.  As such, servers must
       include any intermediate CAs necessary for building a trust chain in the JWT `x5c` header OR as an additional
       trust anchor certificate input to the test (see input instructions for more details).
