## Overview

The UDAP Security Client Test Suite verifies the conformance of
client systems to the STU 1.0.0 version of the HL7速 FHIR速
[Security for Scalable Registration, Authentication, and Authorization (UDAP Security) FHIR IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/udap-security/STU1/).

## Scope

The UDAP Security Client Test Suite verifies that systems correctly implement
the [UDAP Security IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/udap-security/STU1/)
for authorizating and/or authenticating with a server in order to gain 
access to HL7速 FHIR速 APIs. At this time, the suite only contains tests for
the [Business-to-Business Client Credentials flow](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/udap-security/STU1/b2b.html).

These tests are a **DRAFT** intended to allow implementers to perform
preliminary checks of their systems against UDAP Security IG
and [provide feedback](https://github.com/inferno-framework/udap-security-test-kit/issues)
on the tests. Future versions of these tests may verify other
requirements and may change the test verification logic.

## Test Methodology

For these tests Inferno simulates a UDAP server that supports the business-to-business
client credentials flow. Testers will
1. Provide to Inferno the client URI with which they will register their system.
2. Make a dynamic registration request to Inferno using the provided client URI
   and including the X.509 certificate used to sign the registeration and subsequent
   token requests which must also have the client URI as a Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
   value in the certificate.
3. Obtain an access token with a request using the client Id returned during registration
   and signed using same X.509 certificate supplied during registration.
4. Use that access token on a FHIR API request.

The simulated UDAP server is relatively permissive in the sense that it will often
provide successful responses even when the request is not conformant. When
requesting tokens, Inferno will return an access token as long as it can find
the client id and the signature is valid. This allows incomplete systems to
run the tests. However, these non-conformant requests will be flagged by
the tests as failures so that systems will not pass the tests without being
fully conformant.

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start

The following inputs must be provided by the tester at a minimum to execute
any tests in this suite:
1. **UDAP Client URI**: The UDAP Client URI that will be used to register with
   Inferno's simulated UDAP server.

The *Additional Inputs* section below describes options available to customize
the behavior of Inferno's server simulation.

### Demonstration

To try out these tests without a UDAP client implementation, these tests can be exercised
using the UDAP Security server test suite and a simple HTTP request generator. The following
steps use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to generate the access request using 
[this collection](https://github.com/inferno-framework/udap-security-test-kit/blob/main/lib/udap_security_test_kit/docs/demo/FHIR%20Request.postman_collection.json).
Install the app and import the collection before following these steps.

1. Start an instance of the UDAP Security Client test suite.
2. From the drop down in the upper left, select preset "Demo: Run Against the UDAP Security Server Suite".
3. Click the "RUN ALL TESTS" button in the upper right and click "SUBMIT"
4. In a new tab, start an instance of the UDAP Security Server Test Suite
5. From the drop down in the upper left, select preset "Demo: Run Against the UDAP Security Client Suite"
6. Select test group **2** UDAP Client Credentials Flow from the left panel, click the "RUN ALL TESTS" button
   in the upper right, and click "SUBMIT"
7. In the Client suite tab, click the link in the wait dialog to continue the tests.
8. In the Server suite tab, find the access token to use for the data access request by opening
   test **2.3.01** OAuth token exchange request succeeds when supplied correct information, click
   on the "REQUESTS" tab, clicking on the "DETAILS" button, and expanding the "Response Body".
   Copy the "access_token" value, which will be a ~100 character string of letters and numbers (e.g., eyJjbGllbnRfaWQiOiJzbWFydF9jbGllbnRfdGVzdF9kZW1vIiwiZXhwaXJhdGlvbiI6MTc0MzUxNDk4Mywibm9uY2UiOiJlZDI5MWIwNmZhMTE4OTc4In0)
9. Open Postman and open the "FHIR Request" Collection. Click the "Variables" tab and add the
   copied access token as the current value of the `bearer_token` variable. Also update the
   `base_url` value for where the test is running (see details on the "Overview" tab).
   Save the collection.
10. Select the "Patient Read" request and click "Send". A FHIR Patient resource should be returned.
11. Return to the client tests and click the link to continue and complete the tests.

The client tests should pass. On the server side some of the registration tests will fail. This is
expected as the Server tests make several intentionally invalid token requests. Inferno's simulated UDAP
server responds successfully to those requests when the client id can be identified, but flags them as
not conformant causing these expected failures. Because responding successfully to non-conformant
registration requests is itself not conformant there are corresponding failures on the server test.

### Additional Inputs

One additional input is available to support testers 
- **FHIR Response to Echo**: The focus of this test kit is on the auth protocol, so the
  simulated FHIR server implemented in this test suite is very simple and will by default
  return a FHIR OperationOutcome to any request made. Testers may provide a static
  FHIR JSON body for Inferno to return instead. In this case, the simulation is a simple
  echo and Inferno does not check that the response if appropriate for the request made.

## Current Limitations

This test kit is still in draft form and does not test all of the requirements and features
described in the UDAP Security IG for clients. Notably, only the B2B client credentials flow
is tested at this time.

The following sections list other known gaps and limitations.

### UDAP Server Simulation Limitations

This test suite contains a simulation of a UDAP server which is not fully
general and not all conformant clients may be able to interact with it. One
specific example is that the UDAP configuration metadata available at
`.well-known/udap` for the simulated server is fixed and cannot be changed by
testers at this time. Despite the current limitations, the intention is for Inferno to
support a variety of conformant choices, so please report issues that prevent conformant
systems from passing in the [github repository's issues page](https://github.com/inferno-framework/udap-security-test-kit/issues/).

### FHIR Server Simulation Limitations

The FHIR server simulation used to support clients in demonstrating their ability to access
FHIR APIs using access tokens obtained using the UDAP flows is very limited. Testers are currently
able to provide a single static response that will be echoed for any FHIR request made. While
Inferno will never implement a fully general FHIR server simulation, additional options may be added
in the future based on community feedback.
